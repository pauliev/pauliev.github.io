Reuse Transformation Logic You can use dataflows to create reusable transformation logic that can be shared by many datasets. Dataflows promote reusability and prevents the need to create separate connections to data sources. 2. Get Your Data Outside of Power BI You can use dataflows to expose the data in your own Azure Data Lake Gen 2 sto... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Eight Essential Steps for Building Great Data Experiences</title><link href="https://thedata.zone/posts/eight-essential-steps-for-building-great-data-experiences/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Eight Essential Steps for Building Great Data Experiences" /><published>2021-04-21T00:00:00-03:00</published> <updated>2021-04-21T12:19:13-03:00</updated> <id>https://thedata.zone/posts/eight-essential-steps-for-building-great-data-experiences/</id> <content src="https://thedata.zone/posts/eight-essential-steps-for-building-great-data-experiences/" /> <author> <name>Paul Vermette</name> </author> <category term="guidelines" /> <summary> Do you want to create great data experiences?

Unfortunately, at the time of this post, there is no straight-forward method to support a dataflow lifecycle. In this post I define a framework that supports a dev-test-prod lifecycle. You will still need to export and import data... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Welcome to the new datazone</title><link href="https://thedata.zone/posts/welcome-to-new-datazone/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to the new datazone" /><published>2021-03-28T00:00:00-03:00</published> <updated>2021-04-05T11:56:40-03:00</updated> <id>https://thedata.zone/posts/welcome-to-new-datazone/</id> <content src="https://thedata.zone/posts/welcome-to-new-datazone/" /> <author> <name>Paul Vermette</name> </author> <category term="news" /> <summary> I want to focus on a content so I decided to go to a simple approach for my website.
